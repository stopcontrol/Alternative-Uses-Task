Alternate Uses (also known as Guilford's Alternate Uses) is a revised and improved form of the test Unusual Uses, which was originally designed (Wilson, Guilford, Christensen & Lewis, 1954) to represent an expected factor of "flexibility of thinking" in an investigation of creative thinking. Each item represents the name of well-known object, such as a newspaper, with a statement of its ordinary use. The participant is to list as many as six other, uncommon uses for the object, in the time allowed.
The Alternate Uses score relates to:
•	Originality
•	Fluency
•	Flexibility
•	Elaboration
In both forms, Alternate Uses is divided into two separately timed parts of three items each, in order to help the survey participants to distribute their time more equitably among the items.
